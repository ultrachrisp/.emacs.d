#+TITLE: README

This is a remake of [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/emacs-rimero-setup][emacs-rimero-setup]] & [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/emacs.d][yveszoundi]] for easier reuse in a non obstrusive way.

The setup is loaded via an =org= file, see the [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/emacs.d/blob/master/bootstrap/startup.org][startup.org]] file in the =bootstrap= folder.

* Just testing the setup

Replace *GIT-CHECKOUT-FOLDER* with the folder where you cloned the project.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  emacs -q -l ~/GIT-CHECKOUT-FOLDER/init.el
#+end_src

The above-mentioned sample =init.el= is provide as an example only, for integration, see the next section.

* Integration with your own customizations

Below is a simple =.emacs.d/init.el= startup file.

Again replace *GIT-CHECKOUT-FOLDER* with the folder where you cloned the project.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables
   ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
   ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
   ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
   ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
   '(ers-env-variables
     (quote
      (("JAVA_HOME" . "/opt/java6")
       ("EDITOR"    . "emacsclient")
       ("LC_ALL"    . "C")
       ("LANG"      . "en"))))
   '(send-mail-function (quote smtpmail-send-it)))
  
  (custom-set-faces
   ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
   ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
   ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
   ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
