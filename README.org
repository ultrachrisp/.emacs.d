#+TITLE: My Emacs Setup

This is a remake of [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/emacs-rimero-setup][emacs-rimero-setup]] & [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/emacs.d][yveszoundi]] for easier reuse in a non obtrusive way.

I am relying on emacs a lot more these days, and this setup allowed me to bring more order to what was a fairly chaotic setup structure.

The setup is loaded via an =org= file, see the [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/emacs.d/blob/master/bootstrap/startup.org][startup.org]] file in the =bootstrap= folder.

* Just testing the setup

Replace *GIT-CHECKOUT-FOLDER* with the folder where you cloned the project.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  emacs -q -l ~/GIT-CHECKOUT-FOLDER/init.el
#+end_src

The above-mentioned sample =init.el= is provide as an example only, for integration, see the next section.

* Integration with your own customization's

Below is a simple =.emacs.d/init.el= startup file.

Again replace *GIT-CHECKOUT-FOLDER* with the folder where you cloned the project.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; This a sample emacs init file ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el

(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
)

(custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 )


;; Just for testing, for the typical setup see the README file, use the full path to startup.org..
(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name
                      (concat
                       (file-name-as-directory
                        (concat (file-name-as-directory (file-name-directory load-file-name)) "bootstrap"))
                       "startup.org")))
