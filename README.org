#+TITLE: My Emacs Setup

This is a remake of [[https://git.jeremydormitzer.com/jdormit/dotfiles/src/commit/8266a2c24a1077ff740e570dba25df7150559b1e/emacs/init.org][Jeremy Dormitzer]]'s Emacs setup. 

This is fairly heavy rework of my previous setup, which was based off of [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/emacs.d][yveszoundi]]'s approach, but there are a fair amount of similarities.

Some of the biggest new features are:
- Use of [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]] for a consistent developer environment across languages.
- Use of [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] for package management.

Additionally, it has a cleaner management of the init.org file, which allows for a quick application of updates.
